## Tutor Help

I received help from Chris Baird(Tutor) and JProodian from AskBCS on this assignment. Specifically, with lines 38-49
in the HTML code concerning how to make each individual image/card for the images and how to deploy the site
to a live server. Also, Chris helped me with the hover element and how to affect the opacity in style.css on lines
60-83.
